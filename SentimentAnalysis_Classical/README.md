- Context: This educational notebook explores the field of sentiment analysis, a key component of natural language processing (NLP) that focuses on identifying and categorizing opinions expressed in text. The project aims to provide practical insights into how sentiment analysis can be applied to social media content, using traditional machine learning techniques.

- Task: The primary task was to develop a sentiment analysis model capable of classifying tweets as positive or negative. For this purpose, the Sentiment140 dataset was chosen due to its relevance and widespread use in sentiment analysis studies. To make the project manageable and computationally efficient, only 10% of the dataset was utilized.
 
- Action: The dataset was cleaned to remove extraneous characters, ensuring the quality and consistency of the text data. Tweets were tokenized into individual words, and common stop words were removed to focus on the more meaningful components of the text. A brief EDA was conducted, examining aspects like the length of tweets, to gain deeper insights into the dataset. A Logistic Regression model was chosen for its effectiveness in binary classification tasks. The model was trained to predict whether a tweet expresses a positive or negative sentiment.

- Result: The Logistic Regression model achieved an accuracy of 77%, demonstrating a reasonable level of effectiveness in classifying the sentiment of tweets. This outcome serves as a valuable learning experience in applying classical machine learning techniques to real-world NLP tasks, particularly in the context of sentiment analysis on social media content.
