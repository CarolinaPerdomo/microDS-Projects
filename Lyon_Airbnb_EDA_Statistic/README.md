- Context: Little data project to gain valuable insights into the Airbnb market in Lyon, France. The goal was to explore and understand the pricing patterns, property types, and room types in this dynamic city. Why Lyon? Because I recently traveled there on my summer vacations 2023.

- Task: I performed a descriptive statistical analysis on a dataset of Lyon Airbnb listings. This involved data preprocessing, exploring relationships between listing attributes, and identifying common property and room types. I also investigated the verage ratings and review counts.

- Action: To achieve these, I processed the data, conducted thorough statistical analyses, and created insightful data visualizations. I utilized Python and data analysis libraries to calculate average prices. 

- Result: Notably, I highlighted the most common property and room types and identified a substantial percentage of licensed listings, with opportunities for further investigation.
